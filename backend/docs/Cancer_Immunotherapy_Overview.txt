Cancer Immunotherapy in Progress: An Overview of the Past 130 Years

Cancer immunotherapy represents one of the most significant breakthroughs in cancer treatment, harnessing the body's immune system to fight cancer cells. Here's a concise historical overview:

Late 19th Century (1890s):
- William Coley, considered the "father of immunotherapy," used bacterial toxins (Coleyâ€™s toxins) to stimulate the immune system against cancer, observing tumor shrinkage in several patients.

Early to Mid-20th Century (1900-1960):
- Progress slowed due to inconsistent results and the rise of radiation and chemotherapy.
- Nonetheless, understanding of immune mechanisms began expanding significantly.

1960-1990:
- Discovery and understanding of immune cells, cytokines, and immune signaling pathways.
- Development of cytokine therapies, notably interferon-alpha and interleukin-2 (IL-2), providing proof-of-concept for immunotherapy.

1990-2010:
- Approval of cytokine therapies, with IL-2 approved for melanoma and renal cell carcinoma.
- Development of therapeutic cancer vaccines, such as Sipuleucel-T (Provenge), approved in 2010 for prostate cancer.
- Identification and study of immune checkpoints, proteins that regulate immune responses, notably CTLA-4 and PD-1/PD-L1.

2010-Present:
- Revolution through immune checkpoint inhibitors:
  - Ipilimumab (anti-CTLA-4) approved in 2011 for metastatic melanoma.
  - Pembrolizumab and nivolumab (anti-PD-1) approved for various cancers including melanoma, lung cancer, kidney cancer, and others.
  - Atezolizumab, durvalumab, and avelumab (anti-PD-L1) further expand treatment options.

- Emergence of CAR-T cell therapies:
  - Approval of Kymriah (tisagenlecleucel) in 2017 for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).
  - Approval of Yescarta (axicabtagene ciloleucel) for large B-cell lymphoma.

- Continued advancements:
  - Development of combination therapies enhancing efficacy.
  - Ongoing exploration of personalized immunotherapies, including neoantigen vaccines and personalized T-cell therapies.

Today, cancer immunotherapy remains a rapidly advancing field, continuously improving outcomes and transforming cancer care by leveraging the power of the immune system.
